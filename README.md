# custom_neural_network
A neural network written with NumPy

Two distinctive features of this particular code is that 

1) you can vary the number of layers and output neurons and 
2) the training samples are completely vectorised. 

This notebook will go through how the n-layer, m-output (n and m are varying integers) neural network works. This is a fully vectorised network, meaning that the use of for-loops is replaced with numpy vectors whenever possible to reduce the run-time.
